# Faux-Automobile-Database
"Website" built to learn about building databases. Built as a CS undergrad project that only demo-ed locally (didn't ever see the light of day beyond the instructor / TAs eyes). I helped build this project with Jenn and Kevin, the last names of which are not present to protect their identities.
